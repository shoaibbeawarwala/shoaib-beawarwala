Hello I am shoaib beawarwala, I am about 3days 13hrs and 17.5mins into my coding journey in html javascript and css,
here are some projects ive made along that long period of time, these include a basic colourflipper and a ripoff of my uncle's fashion site Bold N Boho do give the original a look if you like, I am a veteran in coding as you can tell by my work experience so some tips will be much appreciated at my mail shoaibbeawarwala@gmail.com
